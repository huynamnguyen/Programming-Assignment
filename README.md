# Programming Assignment

I created a Travel Agency called "Magic Holidays Agentur" and assigned 3 fictional customers to it.
Each of the customers has the following variables:

- Anrede (enum)
- Vorname (String)
- Nachname (String)
- Adresse (object consisting of multiple strings)
- Geburtsdatum (String)
- Telefonnummer (String)
- E-mail (String)
- Kundennummer (String)
- Bezahlmethoden (object cosisting of multiple strings)

The Travel Agency has the following variables:

- name: (String)
- UST-IDNR: (String)
- Adresse (object consisting of multiple strings)
- Kunde(ArrayList)

If run the program will show all the data of the Travel Agency and the assigned fictional customers.
